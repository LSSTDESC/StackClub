    "This notebook demonstrates a few of the interactive features of the Bokeh, HoloViews, and Datashader plotting packages in the notebook environment. These packages can be used to create quite sophisticated dashboard-like interactive displays and widgets. The goal of this notebook is to provide and introduction and starting point from which to create more advanced, custom interactive visualizations. As a source of inspiration, check out this beautiful [example notebook](https://github.com/timothydmorton/qa_explorer) using HSC data created with the [qa_explorer](https://github.com/timothydmorton/qa_explorer) tools.\n",

    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "After working through and studying this notebook you should be able to\n",
    "   1. Use `bokeh` to create interactive figures with brushing and linking between multiple plots\n",
    "   2. Use `holoviews` and `datashader` to create two-dimensional histograms with dynamic binning to efficiently explore large datasets   \n",
    "\n",
    "Other techniques that are demonstrated, but not empasized, in this notebook are\n",
    "   1. Use `parquet` to efficiently access large amounts of data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistics\n",
    "This notebook is intended to be runnable on `lsst-lspdev.ncsa.illinois.edu` from a local git clone of https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/StackClub."
