# DM Stack Club

Learning the LSST DM Stack, by writing jupyter notebook tutorials.

## Project Tutorials

* The LSST Project DM team keeps its tutorial notebooks in the [lsst-dm-tutorial](https://github.com/lsst-dm-tutorial) organization. Watch out: they will only run if you edit them correctly! (You can find the working demo in a separate branch.)
* The LSST Project SQuaRE team also has some [demo notebooks](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/notebook-demo)
* Robert Lupton has a nice set of [Demos](https://github.com/RobertLuptonTheGood/notebooks/tree/master/Demos)

## Community Tutorials

Coming soon! Our goal is to build on the existing LSST DM Stack demo and tutorial notebooks to create a set of 
_community-generated, community-oriented_ notebooks that reflect the science interests and expected analyses of 
the LSST Science Collaborations.
