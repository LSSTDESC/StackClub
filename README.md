This is an LSSTC-supported project, to form a small community committed to learning how to use, and explain, the LSST DM Stack. 

We're following a 3-phase plan, which you can read about in more detail [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/103kzjOklSUWo5MJP9B-EsnAdO7V6bstTC_mzBvd0NIk/edit#). Phase 0 is collecting existing tutorials and identifying potential club members from around the LSST Science Collaborations. Then, in Phase 1 (late May 2018 to mid August 2018) we'll work together to turn a subset of those existing "seed" tutorials into community-maintained jupyter notebooks, for display at the August LSST 2018 Project and Community Workshop. Then, we plan to open up to a larger group from the science collaborations starting at the PCW, extending and spinning off the initial set of notebooks. The idea is that the best way to learn something is to try and teach it: if you can write a useful tutorial on part of the DM Stack, you have to understand that part first.

If you have questions, please [write us an issue](https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/DMStackClub/issues/new)! 

## LSST Project Demos and Tutorials

* The LSST Project DM team keeps its tutorial notebooks in the [lsst-dm-tutorial](https://github.com/lsst-dm-tutorial) organization. Watch out: they will only run if you edit them correctly! (You can find the working demo in a separate branch.)
* The LSST Project SQuaRE team also has some [demo notebooks](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/notebook-demo)
* Robert Lupton has a nice set of [Demos](https://github.com/RobertLuptonTheGood/notebooks/tree/master/Demos)
* The v15 DM Stack release comes with a nice set of [HTML data processing tutorials](https://pipelines.lsst.io/index.html), by Jonathan Sick

## Community Tutorials

Coming soon! Our goal is to build on the existing LSST DM Stack demo and tutorial notebooks above to create a set of 
_community-generated, community-oriented_ notebooks that reflect the science interests and expected analyses of 
the LSST Science Collaborations.
