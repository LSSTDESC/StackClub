    "> GM note:  if a newbie user is terribly confused and, in the learning stage makes mistakes, what is the \"reset\" command in the jupyterlabdemo environment?  If such a user dilligently and frequently saves (\"pushes\") version of the notebook she/he is working on, there is presumably no danger to be going to the starting place when something goes wrong?\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you are in the development branch.  Do this by typing, for example,\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have successfully started a terminal via the Launcher, you should clone the DMStackClub repo via \n",

    "git clone https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/DMStackClub.git\n",
    "``` \n",
    "and are all set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that it might take a long time to start an instance of jupyterlab (often 5 minutes or so).  According to KSK, it does not really matter which kernel you use; we tend to start with \"version 15\" and use \"small\" size (at least for now).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Also please make sure you are using the correct version of python;  this might be obvious to some, but editing / running the same notebook with different versions of python might cause problems.  "
