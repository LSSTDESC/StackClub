# Getting Started with JupyterLab

_[Greg Madejski](https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/DMStackClub/issues/new?body=@Madejski) and Phil Marshall_

We are developing tutorial notebooks on remote JupyterLab instances, to short-circuit the DM stack installation process and get used to working in the 
notebook aspect of the LSST science platform. In these notes we provide:
* Notes on how to get set up on JupyterLab at NCSA
* Some tips for using JupyterLab effectively.

> NB. In Phase 0, we made use of the [jupyterlabdemo.lsst.codes](https://jupyterlabdemo.lsst.codes/user/madejski/lab?redirects=1)
instance, set up by the DM team in the Google cloud. For Phase 1, we will be using the LSST JupyterLab instance at the LSST Data Facility, NCSA.

## Setting up at NCSA

The LSST technote ["SQR-025: Welcome to the Notebook Aspect of the LSST Science Platform"](https://sqr-025.lsst.io/) provides a good introduction to the NCSA system. The JupyterLab instance is at https://lsst-lspdev.ncsa.illinois.edu/nb

To get an account at NCSA, please contact Simon Krughoff (@ksk on LSSTC Slack). You'll then be invited to [create an account at NCSA](https://identity.ncsa.illinois.edu/).
